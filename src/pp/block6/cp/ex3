1.
Thread 1        Thread 2
x = 1           y = 1
j = y           i = x

possible values:
i   j
1   1
1   0
0   1
0   0   <= if compiler reorders code


2.
Thread 1        Thread 2
answer = 42     if (ready) then
ready = true        println(answer)

possible value:
answer
42
0       <= if compiler reorders code

write to a volatile fields always happends before the read of that field,
meaning that the volitile variable answer will be assigned the value 42
before it is printed.


3.
Thread 1        Thread 2
r1 = x          r2 = y
if r1>0 then    if r2>0 then
    y=1             x=1

r1=r2=1 is a possible value because:
x and y are constants of value 0/1
    -> so x and y are nonnegative
        -> if guards are true
            -> writes can be moved early (y=1 and x=1)
